### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by! 

My name is Evan (he/him), and I'm a department manager at a high-volume law firm specializing in administrative law. I have taken up programming in an effort to improve our firm's performance in case selection, litigation strategies, and financial forecasting. 

I'm currently learning Python, primarily directed towards data analysis and data science elements.

I will probably need to keep many of my repositories private while I continue to work on these programs, as many of them will contain proprietary information. That being said, I will work to make my efforts as transparent as possible, given any restrictions placed upon me and my work by my employer.

All data pulled from client files (past and present) will be thoroughly anonymized.

Thanks! Feel free to email me at evanmlind[at]gmail[dot]com if you have any questions or want to collaborate!
